This is where you can find all the labs for **Mobile Application Development**.

**(The supporting Lecture Material can be found [here](https://ddrohan.github.io/mad-2016/index.html "Supporting Lecture Material for these Labs"))**

We will be covering a comprehensive look at Android using a Case Study called ***CoffeeMate***

The labs will begin with a relatively simple Android app and progress on to a fully fledged App with Custom Adapters, Custom Fragments, Navigation (via the **Nav Bar**), Custom Views, built-in persistence, **Google+ Sign-in**, Networking with **Volley** and **Google Maps**.
