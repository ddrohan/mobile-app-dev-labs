#Objectives

In this Lab, you will be required to refactor our CoffeeMate Case Study, called <b>CoffeeMate.2.0</b>. We will build on the previous lab and add in some new features and UI Design. In this version we will add in a few more activities and some extra layouts, as well as applying some custom styles. On completion of this lab you'll be able to 

- apply a 'Theme' to your application.

- use 'Bundles' to pass data between activities.

- apply styles to different widgets on different layouts.

- use Custom Adapters.

- use Fragments.
