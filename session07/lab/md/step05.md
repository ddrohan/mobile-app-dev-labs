#View Users Coffee Locations

The last step in this lab involves displaying the users coffees on the map, along with the users location (which was the last step) so we need to modify a few classes here, namely

- MapFragment
- AddFragment
- EditFragment

###MapFragment

Here we need to inspect our list of coffees and (using the longitude and latitude coordinates) place a marker on the map indicating the location of each coffee.

So, first, open up your MapFragment class and add the following method

~~~java
public void addCoffees(List<Coffee> list){ for(Coffee c : list) getMap().addMarker(new MarkerOptions() .position(new LatLng(c.marker.coords.latitude, c.marker.coords.longitude)) .title(c.name + " â‚¬" + c.price) .snippet(c.shop + " " + c.address) .icon(BitmapDescriptorFactory.fromResource(R.drawable.coffee)));}
