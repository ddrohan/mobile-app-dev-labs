#Setup - Starter Code

As with the previous labs, you can download the starter code for this lab here - [CoffeeMate.6.0.Starter](../archives/CoffeeMate.6.0.Starter.zip). It's bacisally a copy of CoffeeMate.5.0, so if you wish, you could just continue on with your own version.

Eitherway, It's probably still a good idea to run the App and confirm that the starter app (our your app) is configured properly and (still) running.

In this lab, you are required to do the following:

- Add Location awareness to the App (via a custom MapsFragment class)

- Add a Google Map, so the user can see their coffees displayed on a Map

- Add Volley Support to CoffeeMate to manage our coffees and their locations on the server (our APi already does this)

The following steps will guide you through these requirements, but before we can do anything with the Google Maps, you need to obtain your own Google Maps Key to add to your manifest file.
