#Objectives

In this Lab, you will continue to refactor our CoffeeMate Case Study, this version is called <b>CoffeeMate.7.0</b>. We will build on previous labs and add in Location and Map Support. In this version we will add in a few more activities and some extra layouts and also use some helper classes. On completion of this lab you'll be able to 
 
- make CoffeeMate location aware

- view individual coffees on a Map

- use a ViewPager to 'swipe' between the Search page and the Map page
