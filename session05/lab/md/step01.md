#Setup - Starter Code

As this version of our case study has been substantially refactored to begin with, it's strongly recommended you download the starter code for this lab here - [CoffeeMate.4.0.Starter](../archives/CoffeeMate.4.0.Starter.zip). It contains all the resources you'll need to complete this lab along with some of the code and features already completed.

Once you import the <b>CoffeeMate 4.0 Starter</b> Project it should looks as follows:

Take a few moments to familiarise yourself with the <b>new (highlighted)</b> Activities, Classes in your project and explore the resources that you will be referring to throughout the lab, especially the layouts in both 'Graphical Layout' view and 'XML' view. It's also probably a good idea to run the App at this stage too, so you can set up your AVD (if you haven't done so already) and confirm that the starter app is configured properly and running (although you'll only see a blank screen!).

In this lab, you are required to do the following:

- Add a Splash Screen (to make the app a bit more 'appealing')

- Use <i><b>SharedPreferences</b></i> and a Login Screen so we can implement some basic Security

- Add a Logout Button to the menu 

- Add Database Support to CoffeeMate to manage our coffees

The following steps will guide you through these requirements, so we'll start with Splash Screen.
