#App Refactoring - Our 'Add' Option

Once you've properly tested the latest version of CoffeeMate, you'll see that we only have The 'Home' & 'View Favourites' implemented (from the starter App). This step will take you through building a new Fragment <b>AddFragment</b> and reusing a lot of the 'Add' activity code and resources. 

(You can literally drag-and-drop the files into eclipse! <b>NOTE : Make sure you drop in the images first or you'll get a number of errors in your resources file</b>)

You may also get a resource error on the layout regarding a colour, so if you do, update your 'colors.xml' with the following

~~~java
 <color name="bar_black_text">#000000</color>
~~~

The Login Screen looks like this:
