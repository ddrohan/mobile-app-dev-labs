# App Refactoring - Our 'Edit' Option \(Part 1\)

This step is similar to our 'Add' Fragment implementation but there's a bit more complexity involved as we need to

* Create a new Fragment \(**EditFragment**\) \(similar to Add\)
* Recycle the 'Edit' Layout for use with our new Fragment \(similar to Add\)

and
* Pass the relevant Coffee Data from the 'Coffee List' \(managed within the **CoffeeFragment**\) to the **EditFragment**
