#Setup - Starter Code & Configuring Volley

As this lab builds directly on the previous lab, but requires a number of helper classes you can download the starter code for the lab here - [CoffeeMate.5.0](../archives/CoffeeMate.5.0.Starter.zip).

In this lab, you are required to do the following:

- Refactor <b>CoffeeMate.4.0</b> replacing all Database calls with the Web Service calls (one of which is done already). This particular lab is concerned with initially using <b>Volley</b> to make our API calls and ultimately intrgrating <b>Google+ SignIn</b> to allows us to securely login to our sister Web App - <a href="http://coffeemateweb.herokuapp.com">CoffeeMateWeb</a> and still offer the same functionality on the App.

I would also like to bring to your attention our <b>Coffee</b> class as it has been refactored (simplified) for use with the Web Service, we will be using this version of the model in subsequent Labs.
