#Setup - Starter Code & Configuring Volley

As this lab builds directly on the previous lab, but requires a number of helper classes you can download the solution for the lab here - [CoffeeMate.5.0](../archives/CoffeeMate.5.0.Starter.zip).

In this lab, you are required to do the following:

- Refactor <b>CoffeeMate.4.0</b> replacing all Database calls with the Web Service calls - which is done already :-) This particular lab is concerned with understanding how the application works and how the background services (AsnycTasks) operate.

- I would like to bring to your attention our <b>Coffee</b> class as it has been refactored (simplified) for use with the Web Service, we will be using this version of the model in the final Lab - <b>CoffeeMate 6.0</b>
