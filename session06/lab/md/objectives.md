#Objectives

In this Lab, you will continue to refactor our CoffeeMate Case Study, this version is called <b>CoffeeMate.5.0</b>. We will build on the previous lab and add in a Web Service API to allow the user to manage their coffees on a remote Server <a href="http://coffeemateweb.herokuapp.com" >CoffeeMateWeb</a>. In this version we will add in the necessary classes to send and receive JSON coffee objects and view them in the app. On completion of this lab you'll be able to 
 
- do everything CoffeeMate.4.0 can do, but this time, manage the Coffee objects <i><b>remotely</b></i>.
