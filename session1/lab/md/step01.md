##Instructions for working in Walton Building PC Labs:

If you are working on the workstations in the IT Building, Android Studio should already be installed so proceed with the next step of the lab.

##Instructions for working on your own laptop

Download and install Android Studio from

 - <https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html>

Select the correct version for your OS. The primary prerequisite for installing Android Studio is that you have a recent Java installation on your workstation. To see if you have Java, and to install it if you do not, visit:

 - <http://www.java.com>

Android Studio looks after downloading the Android SDK for you but you can download and install the Android SDK separately from

- <https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html>

This download is actually the SDK Manager (not the full SDK), where you can choose which versions of the Android platform you want to install & develop with - select <b>anything above API 21 (Version 5.0)</b>. (But I'd leave all the TV and Wearable stuff :) ) 

NOTE : these downloads are quite large so it's advisable to have these versions installed BEFORE class.
